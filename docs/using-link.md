# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Using Link


## Synchronizing with Link

KRFT implements Ableton Link that allows it to synchronize musical beat, tempo, and phase with other applications running on one or more devices.

It's really easy to setup - all you need to do is click on "Ableton Link" in the Master settings page and turn it on. 

In this mode, KRFT will synchronize with other devices.

## Usecases 

- working with Ableton Live
- jamming with other users using KRFT or other Link enabled software
