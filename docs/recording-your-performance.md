# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Recording your performance

It's very straight forward to record your performances in KRFT.


----

1. To begin just tap the record button (the hollow circle) on the right of the Surface toolbar.

2. The toolbar will then turn orange and display "Ready to Record". At this stage the recording is primed. Now, just start playing and KRFT will automatically start recording. The toolbar will turn red with a timer to show how long you have recorded. Simply press the tick when you are finished or the undo button if you would like to start your recording again.

3. Once you have finished your recording will be available under the Recordings tab on the home screen. From there you can listen to and share the file to other apps.
