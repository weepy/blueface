# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Transform Cells

Transform cells take one or more timelines and transform their notes in real time. For example, change the rhythm or add a harmony.

These cells are very powerful and a great source of inspiration.

----


Here's a run down of the different transforms you can apply:

- **Note Repeat** - Repeats notes at a set interval to create a delay like effect.

- **Arpeggiate** - Applies an arpeggiator to the notes with a customizable speed and range. 

- **Rhythmize** - Adds a rhythm to active notes.

- **Harmonize** - Create pitch shifts or harmonies in the songs key or in a chromatic scale.

- **Beat Repeat** - Repeats a section of a timeline that is currently playing.

- **Quantize** - Quantizes all notes to a specified time interval.

- **Reverse** - Reverses the timeline. You can also just reverse the pitch and retain the rhythm by setting it to Pitch mode.

- **Invert** - Inverts the timeline notes pitch.

- **Rotate** - Pushes the notes forward or backwards in time. You can also just rotate the pitch and keep the rhythm.

- **Randomize Key** - Randomize every note by a number of steps in the songs scale.

- **Randomize Time** - Randomize every notes time up to a maximum interval (strength). You can also quantize the resulting time. Use the "skip chance" setting to randomly skip notes.
