# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Dial Cells

Dial Cells are circular. Use to control parameters on channels or instruments in real time e.g. The master tempo, a filter on an instrument, the pitch of the drums. This can be a really useful tool for adding dynamics in your compositions.

Here's a run down of a dial's settings:

- **Property** - The parameter that the dial controls on the Channel or Instrument.

- **Default Value** - The current value of this property on the instrument.

- **Minimum Value** - The lowest value that the dial can set.

- **Maximum Value** - The highest value that the dial can set.

- **Sensitivity** - How far you need to move the dial to adjust the property.

- **Mode** - Whether the dial will retain its position after you release your touch or snap back to the instruments default.

- **Axis** - The axis you drag the dial on to change the value.
