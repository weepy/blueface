# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Group Cells

Group Cells trigger a pre defined selection of cells to play at a specified interval. This is useful to bring some structure to a song or performance or to trigger multiple cells at once that would be normally be difficult. You can configure a Group Cell by just tapping on it in select mode. Here are the options:

----


- **Targets** - Tap this to select which cells you want to trigger. Note, currently only Loops, Fills & Audio cells can be triggered by a Group Cell.

- **Cue Time** - The time that the target cells will be cued to. This will be the next interval on the master timeline based on what you have selected.

- **Mode** - How the target cells and currently playing cells will merge.

    - **Solo** - The target cells will re-synchronise with the master timeline when they start playing. This will override their own sync setting. All currently playing cells will turn off when the target cells start.
    - **Switch** - The target cells will use their own sync setting to sync with the master clock. All currently playing cells will turn off when the target cells start.
    - **Blend** - The target cells will use their own sync setting to sync with the master clock. Other loops playing will continue to play and will not be effected.
