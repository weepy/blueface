# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Morph Cells

Morph cells can be used to change a specific parameter on an instrument or channel over a specified period of time e.g. Pitch up an instrument an octave over 4 bars, set the volume of a channel instantly.

This is great for jamming and adding variety to a loop.

----


Here's a run down of a morphs' settings:

- **Property** - The parameter that the morph controls on the Channel or Instrument.

- **Default Value** - The current value of this property on the instrument.

- **Target Value** - The value you want to be set when this morph is turned on.

- **Time on** - The duration, in notes, of the morph from Default Value to Target Value when activated.

- **Time off** - The duration, in notes, of the morph from Target Value to Default Value when turned off.

- **Interaction** - The interaction required to run the morph on & off
    - **Toggle** - Tap the cell to toggle it on or off
    - **Hold** - Press and hold on the Cell to play it. It will turn off when you let go.
    - **Turn off on exit** - If the cell turns off when you exit the touch area.
