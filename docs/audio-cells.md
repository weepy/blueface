# [KRFT Docs](/docs) :: Audio Cells


Audio Cells are similar to Loops & Fills but instead of playing a timeline they play a piece of audio. This can either be imported or selected from the built in library of samples. As well as adding texture and more organic sounds, they can be useful for adding one shots, adding impact to your performance. Read more about the controls below:

---

- **Sample** - The file that is currently loaded in the Cell. Press "Load" to select another or import your own.

- **Loop Length** - The length of the loop

- **Time Stretch** - Enable this If your audio has a different tempo to your Surface. Select the Original BPM of the audio file and KRFT will automatically stretch the audio to the current Surface tempo.

- **Trim** - The length in seconds to remove from the start of the audio file

- **Volume, pitch, release & attack** - Use these to make some adjustments to your sample.

Audio Cells also have a channel tab and a settings tab, 
much like a Timeline Cell.
