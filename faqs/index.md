- How do I change the settings ?

### I'm experiencing audio lag when playing the Surface, Keyboard or Drum Machine!
Make sure you're not using bluetooth headphones! Also, the Keyboard & Drum Machine are quantized live so it will push the note to the next 16th or 8th note. You can turn this off by tapping the "Quantize" button above the keyboard on the left.

### I've got a feature idea, where do I send it?
The best place to post it is on our forum => <http://studioamplify.chat/c/krft/krft-feature-requests>

### Who owns the output?
You do. We want to build and tool don't intend to claim copyright on produced works.
